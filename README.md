Introduction
Imagine you are the manager at a manufacturing company responsible for monitoring assembly lines. Each assembly line contains multiple kinds 
of machines that must work continuously and reliably to produce ready-to-ship products as can be seen in the image below. IoT sensors placed 
on these machines monitor electricity consumption, noise generated, vibration, temperature and various other measurable quantities that are 
used to monitor the health of each machine. Sudden breakdown of any of these machines across multiple assembly lines will lead to:

Unscheduled downtime and resulting delays in delivering your product to market
Cost incurred due to delays, and hiring maintenance workers to repair and possibly replace parts of the machine that caused the breakdown
You have been tasked with researching a technique called “predictive maintenance”, especially after your competitors Advantech, Inc. have 
published a report (http://www.advantech.com/industrial-automation/industry4.0/pms#my_cen). Additionally, you are intrigued to see if 
Machine Learning can help with this problem. Your team's collective research notes regarding a potential proof-of-concept that you will be 
building is included here:

Project Goal
Create ML model that can predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) on an engine after each run cycle to improve the Predictive Maintenance process. 
With a predictive model, the Maintenance Department can use the information to determine when to perform preventative maintenance on an engine.
This timing improvement will minimize engine down time resulting in increased production output and lower costs.

About the data:
Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set Publications using this data set Description Engine degradation simulation was carried out
using C-MAPSS. Four different were sets simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. Records several
sensor channels to characterize fault evolution. The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames. Format The set is in text 
format and has been zipped including a readme file. Datasets + Download Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set (39327 downloads)
